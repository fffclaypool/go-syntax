/* The Select Statement
  The following rules apply to a select statement âˆ’

	  You can have any number of case statements within a select. Each case is followed
	by the value to be compared to and a colon.

      The type for a case must be the a communication channel operation.

	  When the channel operation occured the statements following that case will execute.
	No break is needed in the case statement.

	  A select statement can have an optional default case, which must appear at the end
	of the select. The default case can be used for performing a task when none of the
	cases is true. No break is needed in the default case.
