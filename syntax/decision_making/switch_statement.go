/*
  A switch statement allows a variable to be tested for equality against a list of
values. Each value is called a case, and the variable being switched on is checked for
each switch case. In Go programming, switch statements are of two types âˆ’

	Expression Switch
	  In expression switch, a case contains expressions, which is compared
	against the value of the switch expression.

	Type Switch
	  In type switch, a case contain type which is compared against the type
	of a specially annotated switch expression.
